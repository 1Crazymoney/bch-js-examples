To run any application in the applications/wallet directory, simply enter:
`npm start`
while in that folder directory (e.g. run "npm start" while in the
applications/wallet/create-wallet directory)

All of the .js files in the applications/wallet directory are set to the
"mainnet" network. For wallet testing purposes, by using the testnet network,
change the following line of code in EACH AND EVERY .js file in the
applications/wallet directories:
`const NETWORK = 'mainnet'
should be changed to:
'const NETWORK = 'testnet'

If you wish to fund your newly created testnet wallet (following the steps above),
you can go to:
https://developer.bitcoin.com/faucets/bch
and enter your BCH testnet (tBCH) wallet address. You will receive a small amount
of tBCH to use for any testing purposes that you wish.
It is also good form to return any unused tBCH to the faucet, their wallet being:
bchtest:qqmd9unmhkpx4pkmr6fkrr8rm6y77vckjvqe8aey35

If you already have BCH, you can test these functions without having to change
any of the code from 'mainnet' to 'testnet within the .js files. A simple 0.005
BCH transaction is enough to fund the wallet for all testing purposes.

The following are steps to follow when using these .js files


applications/wallet/create-wallet

The first action you should perform in the
application/wallet directory should be in the
"create-wallet" directory (using 'npm start')
A new "wallet-info.txt" and "wallet.json" file
will be created for you.

NOTE: RUNNING "npm start" IN THIS DIRECTORY WILL OVERWRITE ANY OLD PREVIOUS
"wallet-info.txt" AND "wallet.json" FILES, SO BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVERWRITE
YOUR OLD ADDRESSES and/or CREATE A BACKUP COPY of the "wallet-info.txt"
and "wallet.json" files

The "wallet.json" file will contain your mnemonic seed phrase for that wallet.
the "wallet.json" file will also contain your primary BCH wallet address.
The "wallet-info.txt" goes a step further: while containing your mnemonic
seed phrase, it also contains 10 different BCH addresses you can use with your
single mnemonic. This is to allow some anonymity to your transactions
(and all 10 addresses can be restored from the single mnemonic phrase).

NOTE: all of the following examples use the "wallet.json" file (with the single
BCH address within) and not the full "wallet-info.txt" file of addresses.
The "wallet-info.txt" file is only an example of how to generate lots of
addresses with a single mnemonic and write them to an external file. Also
note that the first address in "wallet-info.txt" is the same address as the
"wallet.json" file.


applications/wallet/check-balance

Once you send BCH (or tBCH) to your newly made "wallet.json" address, you can
use the wallet/check-balance .js file to update your wallet with the network to
confirm that the coins sent have successfully reached your wallet.  Ran by running
"npm start"
in the wallet/check-balance directory. This will show you your current balance
in your "wallet.json" file's address. Fairly simple and straightforward application.


applications/wallet/send-all

Once you have BCH (or tBCH) in your "wallet.json" address, you can use the function
wallet/send-all to send all of the BCH in your wallet to a single address.
NOTE: the .js file is initally set up to return all BCH to the same wallet
that is being sent from (which will perform a similar action to
wallet/consolidate-utxos, discussed further in the README.txt. To change the
send-all address, change the .js file line from:
const RECV_ADDR = walletInfo.cashAddress
to
const RECV_ADDR = "YourBCHwalletHereInQuotes"


applications/wallet/send-bchtest

Once you have BCH (or tBCH) in your "wallet.json" address, you can use the function
wallet/send-bch to send a specific amount of BCH from your "wallet.json" address
to any address of your choosing.

NOTE: the .js file has to be opened, and your receiving address has to be
changed from:
const RECV_ADDR = ``
to
const RECV_ADDR = 'YourBCHwalletHereInQuotes'

NOTE: the .js file is defaulted to sending 1000 satoshis. Edit this line:
const SATOSHIS_TO_SEND = 1000
to any number you wish, to change the amount of satoshis that will be sent to
the receiving address you entered above


applications/wallet/consolidate-utxos
